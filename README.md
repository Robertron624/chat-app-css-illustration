## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I kept improving my CSS Grid to create a responsive layout. I also stept up my layout skills for creating a smartphone mockup from scratch with HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

I want to complete all intermediate frontend mentor challenges before taking on the advanced ones. I also want to learn more about React and Next.js for projects that require multiple pages and are fullStack. I want to learn more about CSS animations and transitions.
